Coat hooks featuring a Star Trek communicator badge. The hooks are designed to be mounted to a wall and are perfect for hanging coats, hats, or anything else you can think of.

#### Design

The back of the hook is hollowed out to account for uneven walls or dowels wich are not completely flush. This requires supports, but as they are attached to an invisible part of the hook, they don't influence the final appearance at all.

#### Colors

As you can see, introducing a filament change at the right layer provides for a very nice visual effect.

#### Knob

If you change the parameter `type` to `knob` you can print a knob instead of a hook. This is useful if you want to use the badge as a drawer knob or something similar. I haven't printed this version yet though.
