# Star Trek Com Badge Coat Hooks

Coat hooks featuring a Star Trek communicator badge. The hooks are designed to be mounted to a wall and are perfect for hanging coats, hats, or anything else you can think of.

## Colors

As you can see, introducing a filament change at the right layer provides for a very nice visual effect.

## Print instructions

I printed the hooks with 50% cubic infill and used PLA as a material. One of the hooks gave in to the wait of two heavy jackets and a pair of quite heavy jeans. I then reprinted it with 90% cubic infill and cranked up the nozzle temperature to 240°C for the first and 230°C for subsequent layers. 

I also changed the cooling options in PrusaSlicer to improve layer adhesion:

Fan speed min: 50%
Enable dynamic fan speeds: true
speed for 0% overlap (bridge): 50%
speed for 25% overlap: 70%
speed for 50% overlap: 80%
speed for 75% overlap: 100%

Adding more perimters would have made the hook even more sturdy I think, but mine has held up for a few weeks now with no issues, so I had no reason to reprint it.

Also it was only one hook which failed so far, the others are fine, even with the lower infill and cooling settings.

Organic supports work great on this one.

## Knob

If you change the parameter `type` to `knob` you can print a knob instead of a hook. This is useful if you want to use the badge as a drawer knob or something similar. I haven't printed this version yet though.
