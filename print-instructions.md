I printed the hooks with 50% cubic infill and used PLA as a material. One of the hooks gave in to the wait of two heavy jackets and a pair of quite heavy jeans. I then reprinted it with 90% cubic infill and cranked up the nozzle temperature to 240°C for the first and 230°C for subsequent layers.

I also changed the cooling options in PrusaSlicer to improve layer adhesion:

Fan speed min: 50%
Enable dynamic fan speeds: true
speed for 0% overlap (bridge): 50%
speed for 25% overlap: 70%
speed for 50% overlap: 80%
speed for 75% overlap: 100%

Adding more perimters would have made the hook even more sturdy I think, but mine has held up for a few weeks now with no issues, so I had no reason to reprint it.

Also it was only one hook which failed so far, the others are fine, even with the lower infill and cooling settings.

Organic supports work great on this one.
